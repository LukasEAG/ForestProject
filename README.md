# ForestProject

Hi, my name is Łukasz and I'm trying to become Frontend-Developer.

This is my first project of creating webpage without using tutorials. Project Forest is an exercise performed at the end of the course in Mateusz Maj MMC School. Graphic project of home page was provided by course teacher, other subpages was made by me.

## Guidelines for the exercise:

### "The client requests that his website:"

- was created and carefully reproduced based on a mock-up (available for download at the bottom),
- it was made professionally, just like other websites of serious companies (the client doesn't know anything about technical things, so he trusts you to do everything perfectly),
- had a separate "Offer" subpage,
- had a separate "Contact" subpage,
- had your own script written in JS for the hamburger menu,
- some version of scroll-spy is also welcome.

### "The client wants:"

- after clicking on an item in the navigation, the page "slides down" to a given section so that it is not such an "unpleasant jump",
- after clicking "Offer" in the navigation, the page went to the "Offer" section on the main page and did not go to the "Offer" subpage,
- after going to the "Offer" section, there was a link to a subpage with other offers (unfortunately, the graphic designer did not add it to the mock-up, you have to "design" it yourself),
- on the "Contact" subpage there should be a contact form and a map from Google Maps pointing to the McDonald's restaurant on ul. Jasnogórska 2 in Kraków (this is very important to him),
- free icons appeared on his website (e.g. ✔️ in offer cards, ✉️ in the contact form, etc.).

### Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS (Sass/BEM)
- JavaScript
